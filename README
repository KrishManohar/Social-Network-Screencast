== To Install ==

1. Download the code in this repository to the webroot of a site (preferably running
on Apache).

2. Configure your data source settings according to the first screencast in the series:
http://cfwheels.org/screencasts/view/1

3. Now we'll create the database tables that you need using a Wheels plugin called
DBMigrate. In the footer, you will see a section for Plugins. Find a link to the
DBMigrate plugin and click that.

4. Under the "Migrate" section, click the Go button next to "Migrate to version
[All non-migrated]."

5. The screen will reload, indicating that both migrations have run. Check your
database and see whether or not the migrations were successful.
